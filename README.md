# NBA-Draft-Model
This analysis attempts to predict NBA performance based on college statistics. The sample contains college players drafted from 2011-2016. The data includes box score statistics, advanced college statistics, and physical measurements. It is useful to think about uncertainty in the framework of a probability distribution. I used machine learning techniques to predict the probability (or likelihood) that an NBA prospect will be an all-star, starter, bench, and bust.
